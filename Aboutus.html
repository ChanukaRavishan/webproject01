        <h2>About Stevens </h2>
        <p class="paragraph">

            The Stevens Institute of Technology is a leading innovation university, founded in 1870. There is a
            great value in Higher Education, including increased career potential and quality of life. We work
            to
            make high-quality education worthwhile, relevant and accessible. </p>
        <p class="paragraph"> Public good, in the context of a top-tier comprehensive university, includes research, teaching and
            service by which we create knowledge for and with the public. We engage with problems that affect
            the
            public, and we enable each generation of citizens to remake our democracy by equipping them with
            skills
            of critical reasoning and analysis, and a broad sense of civic obligation to the state, the nation,
            and
            the world.
